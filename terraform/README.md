This folder contains Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) placeholders showing how an enterprise batch platform would provision:

- S3 buckets (raw/curated/publish)
- IAM roles & policies for Glue, Step Functions, and Athena
- AWS Glue Data Catalog resources
- SNS topic for batch alerts
- Step Functions State Machine

Note: This repo uses skeleton examples to demonstrate structure and patterns.
